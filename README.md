# NativeApp_Humanoid
This can detect objects in real time from a webcam, have the robot act according to the detected object, and implement a function to notify by voice.

## I created it by adding functions to the Wecam_NativeApp repository webcam.py.
    Use PySide6 instead of PyQt5.
    Added serial port communication function.
    Using gTTS and pygame for voice output.
    Added the ability to perform robot movements when recognizing a specific object.
